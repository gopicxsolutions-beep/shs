/// Exhaustive regression coverage: every *parameterless* route registered in
/// `lib/routes/router.dart` renders without throwing, in demo mode (no
/// Supabase configured — `SupabaseService.isConfigured` stays false here,
/// matching how `app_smoke_test.dart`/`router_error_test.dart`/
/// `dashboards_test.dart` all set up their harnesses, and how the deployed
/// `flutter-web-demo` build actually runs).
///
/// `:id`-parameterized routes (member/loan/meeting/livelihood/product/
/// order/scheme/course/announcement/ticket/analytics-shg detail pages) are
/// deliberately excluded — they need a real id to be meaningful and were
/// already swept for not-found-guard bugs in earlier rounds (see
/// docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md).
///
/// `ShgApprovalPendingPage` (`Paths.shgApprovalPending`) is also excluded:
/// its route is only ever reachable when `AppState.needsShgApproval` is
/// true, which is gated on `SupabaseService.isConfigured` (see
/// `app_state.dart`) — so in demo mode the router's own redirect logic makes
/// it structurally unreachable (any attempt to `go()` there while fully
/// onboarded bounces straight back to the dashboard). Exercising it for
/// real would mean simulating live mode, which is out of scope for a
/// demo-mode smoke test.
///
/// Each route gets its own `testWidgets` (rather than one big loop inside a
/// single test) so a crash on one route doesn't hide the pass/fail status
/// of every route after it in the list.
