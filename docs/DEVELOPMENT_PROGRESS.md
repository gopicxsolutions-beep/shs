# SHG Saathi — Development Progress Log

This file is the durable cross-session record for the "build every module end-to-end
on Supabase" effort. Each work session should read this file first, pick up the next
`pending` module, and update this file before ending.

## Environment status

**Resolved**: Flutter SDK 3.44.6 is now installed at `C:\flutter` (was missing —
stale PATH entry — fixed by downloading via `curl.exe`, NOT `Invoke-WebRequest`,
which throttles large downloads to ~0.24 MB/s due to progress-bar rendering
overhead in Windows PowerShell 5.1). `flutter pub get` and `flutter analyze` both
run cleanly now — 0 errors/warnings on the foundation + Savings + Loans modules
(a handful of trivial info-level lints fixed: unused import, missing `mounted`
check after an async gap, double-underscore lambda params).

**Resolved**: A live Supabase project (`pccbwfmlhpvieetetrpx`) is connected —
see the "Live Supabase project" section below.

**Known limitation — browser automation vs. Flutter web**: the `flutter-web` dev
server (`.claude/launch.json`) runs and renders correctly (verified via
screenshot at a proper mobile viewport, and Supabase does initialize against the
live project), and real button taps work via the Browser pane. But **typing into
Flutter web `TextField`s via generic browser automation does not work** — Flutter
web (CanvasKit renderer) owns its own text-editing state machine; neither
coordinate-based `type`/`key` actions nor manually dispatching DOM `InputEvent`s
on the hidden native `<input>` sync into Flutter's internal state. (Flutter's
accessibility semantics tree *can* be activated by clicking the tiny
`flt-semantics-placeholder` element at viewport (0,0), which makes `read_page`
return real `textbox`/`button` roles — useful for finding elements — but
`form_input` fills only the semantics-layer shadow element, not the real one
Flutter listens to.) **Do not keep fighting this** — for real automated E2E
coverage, use Flutter's own `integration_test` package (drives the app through
Flutter's widget/finder APIs, not raw DOM events) or `flutter drive`, not browser
automation tools. This is the recommended next step for the "comprehensive
end-to-end testing" requirement once enough modules exist to make it worthwhile.

## Architecture pattern (replicate this for every remaining module)

Established while building the Savings module — copy this shape for Loans,
Meetings, etc.:

1. **`lib/models/<domain>.dart`** — a plain Dart class matching the Supabase table
   shape, with a `fromMap(Map<String, dynamic>)` factory. Joins (e.g. member name)
   are read from the nested map PostgREST returns for embedded selects
   (`select('*, profiles(name)')` → `map['profiles']['name']`).
2. **`lib/repositories/<domain>_repository.dart`** — dual-mode, same pattern as
   `AppState`:
   - `bool get _live => SupabaseService.isConfigured;`
   - Every read method takes the caller-resolved id(s) (shgId/memberId — read from
     `context.watch<AppState>().profile`, not re-fetched inside the repository) and
     branches: `if (!_live || id == null) return _mockXxx();` else real Supabase
     query.
   - Mock fallback methods adapt the existing `lib/data/<domain>.dart` const list
     into the new model type — **do not delete the old `lib/data/*.dart` mocks**,
     they're the offline/demo-mode data source now, imported with `as mock` to
     avoid class-name collisions with the new model.
   - Writes (`insert`/`update`) no-op when `!_live` (demo mode has nothing to
     persist to).
3. **`lib/pages/<domain>/*.dart`** — one file per screen from `lib/routes/paths.dart`.
   Use `AppAsyncBuilder<T>` (`lib/widgets/async_state.dart`) for one-shot loads with
   built-in loading/error+retry states, or a raw `StreamBuilder` for realtime
   screens (see `SavingsLedgerPage` for the pattern — only use realtime where
   collaborative live updates actually matter, not on every screen).
4. **`lib/routes/router.dart`** — replace the `comingSoon(Paths.xxx, 'Title')` line
   for each screen with a real `GoRoute(path: Paths.xxx, builder: ...)`.
5. **Navigation**: this app navigates with `context.go()` everywhere (never
   `push()`), which replaces the Navigator stack rather than pushing onto it. Do
   **not** call `context.pop()` after an action (e.g. post-submit) — it may have
   nothing to pop to. Use `context.go(Paths.xxx)` to a known destination instead.

## RLS design decisions (see `supabase/migrations/0002_rls_policies.sql`)

- Within an SHG, members share **read** access to operational data (savings,
  loans, meetings, ledger) — mirrors real SHG transparency (figures are reviewed
  together at meetings). Writes are scoped to the owning member, the shg's
  `leader`, or staff roles (`crp`/`clf`/`admin`).
- `shgs.bank_account`/`ifsc` are sensitive — the base table is members-only, and
  a `shg_directory` view exposes just the safe columns for onboarding search.
- `marketplace_orders` gained a `buyer_id uuid` column (the original schema only
  had a free-text `buyer_name`, which made per-buyer RLS impossible) — see the
  `alter table ... add column if not exists` near the marketplace section.
- Helper functions `current_role()`, `current_shg_id()`, `is_staff()`,
  `is_leader_or_staff()`, `profile_shg_id(uuid)` are `security definer` to avoid
  RLS recursion when a policy needs to read the caller's own profile row.

## Module status

| Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Foundation (RLS, services, AppState, auth) | ✅ done | `0002_rls_policies.sql`, `lib/services/*`, `lib/state/app_state.dart`, auth pages |
| Onboarding (Login/OTP/Profile Setup/Role Select) | ✅ done | Real phone-OTP via Supabase Auth; profile setup persists to `profiles`; SHG search via `shg_directory` view |
| Savings | ✅ done | Model, repository, 5 screens (home/entry/history/ledger[realtime]/statement/group-report), wired in router |
| Loans | ✅ done | Model, repository, 5 screens (home/apply/approval/tracking/detail with payment recording), wired in router incl. `/app/loans/:id` |
| Meetings | ✅ done | Model, repository, 6 screens (home/schedule/attendance roster/self check-in/detail/MoM with decisions+action items), wired incl. `/app/meetings/:id` and `/app/meetings/:id/mom`. QR check-in is real attendance-marking logic behind a tap, not a camera scanner (no camera plugin in pubspec yet) |
| My SHG (members/documents) | ⬜ not started | Member list + detail, document list (Supabase Storage for uploads) |
| Financial records (cashbook/ledger/bank/audit) | ⬜ not started | Backed by `financial_ledger` table |
| Livelihoods | ⬜ not started | `livelihood_activities` table |
| Marketplace (products/orders/reviews) | ⬜ not started | Cross-SHG browsing; needs Supabase Storage for product images |
| Government schemes | ⬜ not started | Catalog + `scheme_applications`; eligibility checker can be client-side rule evaluation for now |
| Training | ⬜ not started | `training_courses` + `course_progress`; quiz screen needs a quiz-content model (not in schema yet — add if needed) |
| Digital payments | ⬜ not started | `payments` table; **external payment gateway is out of scope until keys are supplied** — build the full UI/DB flow with a mock "processor" abstraction (see External APIs section below) |
| Announcements | 🟡 partial | List already reads mock data on dashboards; needs its own repository + detail screen + read-receipt tracking via `announcement_reads` |
| Support (chat/voice/FAQ/tickets) | ⬜ not started | `support_tickets` + `support_messages`; voice support needs an external STT/TTS API — abstract behind an interface, mock for now |
| AI Advisors (financial/scheme/market) | ⬜ not started | `ai_advisor_logs` table exists. **External LLM API is out of scope until keys are supplied** — build a `AiAdvisorService` interface with a canned/mock implementation now, swap in a real provider later |
| Reports | ⬜ not started | `report_snapshots`; snapshots are meant to be generated server-side (Edge Function) — for now, repository can compute on-the-fly client-side from live tables as a placeholder |
| Analytics | ⬜ not started | `analytics_kpis`; CRP/CLF/Admin dashboards already show a version of this from mock data — needs a real repository |
| Admin (users/schemes/monitoring) | ⬜ not started | User role management (admin can update any profile's role per RLS), scheme catalog CRUD, system monitoring (likely needs an Edge Function for real infra metrics — mock for now) |
| Automated tests | ⬜ not started | No `test/` directory exists yet. Add widget tests for the async/repository pattern once 2-3 more modules land, so the test harness matches a stable pattern rather than being rewritten each time |
| Edge Functions | ⬜ not started | None created yet. Candidates once modules are live: report snapshot generation, AI advisor proxy (keeps the LLM key server-side), payment webhook handler |

## External API abstraction plan

Per the requirement to build full architecture now and swap in real providers
later: every module that needs a third-party API (AI advisors, SMS beyond
Supabase's own OTP provider config, payment gateway, voice STT/TTS) should get a
small interface in `lib/services/` with:
- One method per capability (e.g. `Future<String> ask(String prompt)`).
- A `Mock*` implementation returning canned/plausible responses, used until real
  credentials exist.
- The repository/UI layer depends on the interface, not the mock, so swapping in
  a real implementation later is a one-file change.

None of these exist yet — build them alongside their module (e.g. `AiAdvisorService`
when building the AI Advisors module), not speculatively ahead of time.

## Live Supabase project

A real project exists: `pccbwfmlhpvieetetrpx` (URL + anon key in the gitignored
`.env.json`). **Migrations are applied and live** — verified: 27 base tables +
`shg_directory` view, 67 RLS policies, 6 helper functions.

Direct Postgres (`5432`) and the pooler (`6543`) are both unreachable from this
sandbox (HTTPS/443-only egress), so `supabase db push`/`supabase link` don't
work here. What did work: the Supabase **Management API**'s SQL endpoint —
`POST https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/{ref}/database/query` with
`Authorization: Bearer <personal-access-token>` and body `{"query": "<sql>"}` —
which goes over plain HTTPS. The user supplied a personal access token
(different from the anon/service-role keys) for this.

**Gotcha for next time**: Windows PowerShell 5.1's `ConvertTo-Json` pathologically
bloats large strings when serializing a hashtable literal (a 17.7KB SQL file
became a 3.8MB "body", tripping the endpoint's 413 limit) — it appears to
serialize the String object's properties rather than just its value. Build the
JSON body by hand (escape `"`, `\`, and control chars, wrap in `{"query":"..."}"`)
instead of trusting `ConvertTo-Json` for large payloads. Both migration files
went through fine once built manually (18KB and 27.7KB bodies).

The DB password and service-role key the user shared were never written to any
repo file — only the URL + anon key went into `.env.json`. Both remain
sensitive since they were shared in plaintext chat; recommend rotating the DB
password.

## Session log

- **2026-07-17**: Built the foundation (RLS policies for all 27 tables, Supabase
  service/repository layer, real phone-OTP auth wired into onboarding, session-
  aware `AppState`/router redirect logic) and the full Savings module (5 screens +
  realtime ledger). Established the model/repository/page pattern documented above.
- **2026-07-17 (cont'd)**: Built the full Loans module (5 screens: home, apply,
  approval with EMI-entry dialog, tracking, detail with payment recording).
  Started installing the Flutter SDK locally (was missing — stale PATH entry).
  Got real Supabase project credentials from the user; wired `.env.json`
  (client-safe values only); migration push blocked on network/account issues
  documented above. Next: Meetings module, and resolve the migration push.
- **2026-07-17 (cont'd)**: Flutter SDK finished installing (fixed the slow
  download — see environment status above). Got a Supabase personal access
  token from the user and pushed both migrations live via the Management API.
  Ran `flutter analyze` for the first time — 0 errors on the foundation +
  Savings + Loans modules (fixed a handful of trivial lints). Started the
  `flutter-web` dev server and verified it live in the Browser pane: renders
  correctly, Supabase initializes against the real project, real button
  navigation works; documented the browser-automation-vs-Flutter-web-text-input
  limitation above. Built the full Meetings module (6 screens) — `flutter
  analyze` caught one real bug during development (passed a non-existent
  `decoration` param to `AppTheme.sans()`, fixed by using `.copyWith()`
  instead), confirming the analyze-every-module habit is worth keeping.
  Next: My SHG (members/documents) or Financial Records module.
